#rhei.js
## A minimalist flow-based programming framework for node and the browser
If you are reading this, you are likely coming from the article "On Flow-based Programming".

In case you didn't read the warning at the end of that article, let me repeat it here: rhei.js is __just a toy__. It lacks many true FBP features, is not tested thoroughly, is probably riddled with bugs, and __should not be used for anything whatsoever__.

That said, if you are the curious type and just want to play around with this toy, then note that I use ES6 arrow functions here, so you will have to use Firefox as the client. To start the node server, you will have to run (version 0.11+ I think) ```node --harmony app.js``` to enable arrow functions.

Note that the file ```rhei.js``` is the actual 'framework', everything else is just for demonstration purposes... specifically for the purposes of the article "On Flow-based Programming"
